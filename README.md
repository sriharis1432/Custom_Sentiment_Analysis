# Custom_Sentiment_Analysis

Step 1: Data Collection
Collect an SMSSpamCollection dataset of text data labelled with spam, and harm. 

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the text data to make it suitable for model training. This includes tokenization, padding, and converting text to numerical format.

Step 3: Model Building
Build a neural network model for sentiment analysis. using the pre-trained model. DistilBertForSequenceClassification ("distilbert-base-uncased")

Step 4: Model Training
Train the model using the preprocessed data. Fine-tuning for pre-trained model

Step 5: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
